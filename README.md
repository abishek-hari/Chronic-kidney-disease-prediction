# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious and common health condition that
affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of CKD
can help prevent or delay the progression of the disease and improve patient
outcomes. This project aims to develop a machine learning model for early
prediction of CKD using clinical and demographic data, such as laboratory tests,
medical history, and lifestyle factors. The project involves collecting and preprocessing data, identifying important risk factors and features associated with
CKD, selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, training and evaluating
the model's performance, and deploying the model into a clinical workflow or
application for real-time prediction and targeted interventions.
